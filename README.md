# el-proyecte-grande-sprint-1-java-barmin15
This project features a full stack application, with PostgreSQL database, Java Spring-Boot server and REACTjs front-end.
We (three people) worked on it for 4weeks, each week implementing a new feature.
week1: basic structure
week2: database with JDBC connection, JPA and Hibernate.
week3: Java security, JWT token + handling on the front-end.
week4: Docker + container.

The idea for the project, was to create an application for people to connect.
You can register/log in, create events, browse events and join events to meet new people.
